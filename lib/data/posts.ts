    content: [
      "I’ve decided it’s the moment, I go full throttle to what I want, and yes I’ve decided to move out and get it, there’s no partime working, it’s full time now. I’ve no strings to attach to stay. To Get what I’ve set out for I may have to let some stuff go from my rucksack, I leave behind social conformity, I leave all my fears behind me, I leave all the bounds limiting me to be less than what I can be.  A one good friend is enough to sustain happiness, sadness and everything that comes in between. a higher number isn’t necessarily good, I’ve learnt this the hard way.",
      "Everyone will be working when they’re supposed to, everyone will be working hard when the age comes, everyone will earn money when the wallets dry up. Is it really efficient to live this way? If I do these things when I’m supposed to I’m already late. But no, I refuse to walk down this path, I want to work hard now, take my steps now, see the world in all it’s colors now, not when I turn old and fraile. These days when I see my plan giving me the clarity I long wish for, I learn the need to be more disciplined, to be more invested, to be out there everyday. It is my Karma.",
      "I don’t see a instant reward in analysing things as I do in my daily life, It takes me time to really understand the outcomes of my analysis, in the moment it’s unsignificant, over the time it adds up. I’ve tried multiple late night swot analysis, mapping my ideas, writing down my thoughts and what I feel about certain things. They begin to add up. I’ve realised my fear is recurring, “not trying enough”. The best counter action to that is “trying hard enough”. This is the small distance I try to cover everyday. All I really try and will be trying is to, “work everyday” regardless of my feelings/emotions/conditions and all external factors. ",
      "It takes time to build something, months to ideate, maybe years to be great at something, and this is only possible when I’m alone and in touch with my inner self. Solitarity is the only companion in this, this is a choice now. Like all great people once did, I have to pick my own battles. It requires me to be focused, to be in a consistent good mental state, to be dedicated to my goal, to stop worrying about irrational fears, to improvise myself everyday. ",
      "This is my total organisation, building everything, being better.",

    title: "Again, Again, Again",
    content: [
      "This is the first entry of the year 2025 and I want to make it count, I want it to be special in some ways but rigid in other ways. So I’ll divide this in two parts, the first one being the questions I have about what my future and what I’m doing to mould it, the later is more of my inner voice of what I deeply care about.",
      "Side 1: Well so let me put all the variables upfront that I really care about for this year, the first one being my future in tech, all the work I’ll be doing this year, my phyisical health and continuity. I do like writing softwares and coding, this fascincates me more than ever, but sometimes I ask myself what really is my niche? And I don’t get a specific answer about it but I’m fine with that, to say the few I like open source, linux kernel, reinforcement learning and startups. I really like all of these things to my core. Having worked both at startups and companies,  I don’t have a favourite here, I like both of them. The paradox arises when I think about what I’ll choose having to make a decision between the two, I do like the stabality of working in a good company and that’s really necessary to follow my other pursuits. The internal demon in me always wants to work on something new and get my hands at building something and that’s where I think I’ll have to make concisious decisions soon. This is what really goes in my head 24*7.",
      "I haven’t been very caring of my body since a lot of time and I don’t wanna make a drastic 10 hour self care routine, which is of no use to me. I don’t care much about it unless it gets in the way of my work and honestly I can’t really think much about what to do about it, I think I’ll find the answer to this along the way of my journey.",
      "Continuity is the what I probably wonder the most about sometimes, it is the only thing that keeps making me feel alive everyday, I’ve realised that I’ve never grown much with motivation than I have being disciplined, yes it seems boring and it is for the initial phase, but that’s the time where I have to stay disciplined and keep continuing everyday. Earlier I used to fear hardwork and look upto it as something out of my reach, but it is infact showing up everyday and keeping my head up even in the toughest of time. One thing that once really pushed me away from being disciplined was guilt, guilt of not doing something itself propels it. I don’t wanna have that now in my life, no guilts now. I don’t have any new year resolution, all I have is to keep the continuum moving, to do it everyday, EVERY FUCKING DAY. I don’t have any words to express what I feel about it, it is what it is, “doing it everyday”. No matter what happens, what weather, what conditions, but this is all I care about.",

      "Side 2: What I write here is spontaneous and are moving thoughts inside my mind. I’ll begin addressing conformity, the long evil in the pursuit of my dreams, conforming to others about what I’m doing, has been something I have decided not to do anymore, it has caused more harm then good, I am on a long journey and it requires me to be rigid and moulded towards what I want, seeking validation rarely helps to improve and assess, but it just turns evil the moment it becomes a necessity.  It has been inherently built inside me to seek constant validation from others and yes sometimes I resepct I got that, but there are only few people who really give feedback what I call, the mirror persepctive, showing me where I am deviating and what to keep pursuing.",
      "Previously there have been moments of despair when I felt like leaving everything and returing back to normal, live normally. I know I have to keep my head straight and move forward, everyday. How long the path may seem, I need to keep my belief that it is worth walking a thousand miles for and it’s going to work out in the end. The only promise i made to myself is to work for it everyday, no leaves, whatever happens, happens. I have to show up ignoring what could stop me from doing so, be it demotivation, anxiety, stress, despair, hoplessness. I don’t care if my friends are earning a lot more than me or they are travelling around, enjoying their life, having the time of their lives. This is my karma, to work for what I want. I am gonna fix what’s wrong, I am going all the distance.",
      "Also I have to increase my highs and lows, If my high (goal) is easily achieveable then it’s not really something worth spending a lot of time to a lot of people would do that. If I can be happy and content in a easy way out then all of my work would never be the best. I can’t think of any other thing that is of great importance to me, also I decided to write once a month, to just maintain a good record of blogs to track my progress from my reference point, which is set to today.",

      '"Above the planet on wing and a prayer. My grubby halo, a vapour trail in empty air. Across the clouds I            see            my shadow fly, Out of the corner of my watering eye."',
      "So this is me after Brute Forcing one year of my life, what I mean by brute forcing is to stop            listening to all the voices that tell me to stop, to act more civil, to stay in these imaginary locus of            humanly boundaries, to keep up broken friendships, unfinished business. I am not that guy anymore I am            more            younger and            eager to welcome the next year.",
      "What I am adding next to my todo list is an optimisation problem, to optimise for better outcomes in this            game of            probability.            Optimisation is often misunderstood, it is showed comfortable, peaceful but it's not. As one said, the            best            thing to do for me currently is            \"build steel and lay concrete\", after this comes the Optimisation, every            fucking day, every            week for the whole fucking year. well optimisation is a tricky problem for me there's always a need to            keep            the solid efforts in place and continuous while optimising for other things such as choices, options,            trends            etc.",
      "If you're reading till here, you're into me now, believe or not, you are. in my belief criticising others            is            for the            weak,            but if you do remember one thing, the person you're reading right now will wake up every fucking day,            hating            his life, knowing that he sucks at what he            does but even            the cloud bursts on him or the hell let            loose, he'll again wake up next day, do the same shit, do it until he gets better at it, do it until his            soul escapes or he becomes better. I know myself, I know my body enough to know that I am not a            comfortable person, I need to challenge myself everyday to get something, I want. Smartness is not my            forte,            or I'm            smart enough to know that I'm dumb. I can't live comfortably with my problems and make do with all I            have,            there's always this inherent need for more, I am willing to fail instead of living in the despair of not            trying and be stagnant.",

Not anything more than that,            just            the user you're logged in as. If you come across me someday in a cafe or a busy street and you ask me            who            are you? You are just gonna get the user I am logged in as, nothing about what's my story. If you're            reading            here you might find the complete answer to my whoami.",
      "I am not really someone great, I am not even the most motivated one, I am the guy that loves life from            his            nerdy eyeballs and dorky thoughts, life is perfect you might think so, well no actually, it's not. If            you            want to know when did I change myself, or when did all the mess happened in my life, it started last            year,            when I crashed and burnt, I had nothing solid to do, zero self confidence to start with, no clear            picture in            my mind, no \"clarity\" with me. I couldn't believe this is the guy who figured out everything he had to            do in            his life, when he was in 7th grade, I had everything written out to do, to become a good reverse            engineer,            to try my hands at studying outside for my bachelors, to do good in everything I planned to. None of            that            happened, On my last birthday I realised a few things that, I was a 20 year, under acheieved, underlived            kid, who doesn't knows shit about what he wants to do in his, who tried to make other people laugh in            hope            of acceptance and fitting in, was once pretty figured out and now is just burnt out. One thing wasn't            adding            up to the whole equation, \"I knew I didn't want this, this isn't how I would want my life to end            someday\". I            couldn't sleep at nights, possibly my migraine added to sleep insomnia, but life wasn't easy, I couldn't            struggle to even ask someone out and would give up in between, because I knew I am not someone, anyone            would            want to go out with, because I hadn't done anything in my life myself, I am proud of, I've just avoided            truth all together, this was my life's \"Kobiyashi Maru\"",
      "\"I don't believe in the no win scenario\", these words of captain kirk come to my mind whenever I am stuck            at            something. I just decided that this has to end, one way or another, I couldn't wait anymore to do            something            about it, I realised I had to take a stand for me, I just couldn't slip my life away. I stared            distancing            myself from people I felt suppressed from, the ones that insulted me, or made me feel weak. It wasn't            easy            to ignore for what some of people did, I had to. I started living on my own for while, I figured out I            have            to do something to get that, \"clarity\" I started applying for some companies and startups during my            exams,            just to know what I want, I got rejected pretty bad, It wasn't easily, I finally got somehting to start,            everyday for the last 9 months, I worked, even If I'm not working. I started making some \"good money\"            enough            to make me self sufficient to try things on my own, to travel and meet people and gain the exposure I            needed, it came at a cost but I knew I am not going to regret these, I travelled the most I've ever            travelled in my life this year, between cities, in trains, finding my answers, better answers. It has            changed me a lot to start things on my own, to mould life into something I've always wanted, \"to            reprogram            my life's Kobiyashi Maru\", there are 30 days exactly to the end of this year and the start of a new one,            I've grown up to realise that life isn't a short spirnt, it's a marathon, it's not year or months, it's            much            more than that.",
      "Interstingly, I couldn't sleep at a night before yesterday, that lead me into making something I just had            a            slight idea of it was to make scheduling for creators easy, as much as I avoid writing code for            frontend, I            managed to pull of the complete prototype in            a single late night. The waitlist functionality wasn't planned initially but I'm glad I added this, it            gave            meetster a very limited touch, even though the total people who've wailisted till now are just 7, maybe            some            people do give a f*ck, when someone starts something different. I've already started working on the            prototype, the dynamic link generation for creator is a bit of work, but I'll do that too.",
      "This is the answer to my whoami, I know exactly where I wanna go, the things I wanna do, the people I            want &            all that with some randomeness, I am more than            excited to see what life has to bring.            Maybe you would've never realised this backstory at my first glance, but sometimes it's better to start            a            new life, to make new decisions, to meet new people, to start a new journey, this is my new life, you'll            know the places I go            (most of them).",

    title: "Doing The Hard Things.",
    content: [
      "*This post is inspired by casey neistat's video about hard things.",
      "Makes me wonder why would I do anything hard in life? Since I was a kid, going to school was hard, exams            were hard, dating was hard, going to college was hard, and working a full time job was hard. for all I            know            they all added greate value in my life. But I wouldn't have opted for going to school as a child, I            wasn't            that smart maybe. but as a grown up suprisingly for me I opted a lot of hard things this year, I chose            them            now. Why the question still remains, until life recently hit me with the answer. There are rewards to            most            of hard things in life. Working on myself made me more confident, built trust on myself, and changed my            perception in a great way. and unlike childhood where rewards were not that far to get and were pretty            small. Growing up the rewards are far from reach but they are really worth working for and there's no            better            feeling than getting these rewards.",
      "Still the questions remains unanswered, now I think it's how life has shaped itself, getting that short            reward of going to a party spending all of my savings and making my life crash to ground again, this is            thrilling to be real, I accept it. Working every day for hours, indulged in self conservation, working            on            something great, building something exciting, making life beautiful in one more way is what I'm upto            these            days. Nobody really cares if you do either of these two things. I did both of them, life is more harder            the            later way, for weeks, months, years nobody recognises what I am doing, nobody cares enough. But one day            when            walking in your room you see yourself in the mirror and realise that how much you've changed, you            realise            doing hard            things is what makes life beautiul, I realise creation is a hard thing, and this is what I'm upto,            creating            a better life for myself, being a better man. Even though I have days of uncertainity, there's always            something that tells me to keep going, to not stop, to walk it all.",
      "Hard things are what make life beautiful and meaning, even though I know I'm going to stuggle a lot but I            am            not afraid of packing my rusty tools and show up tommorow again to work, lay concrete, build steel. Even            if            it means, leaving my comfort, people, and my past behind, I am ready. All in            all I am learning to fly.",

      "I realise how true, pink floyd's \"mother\" is, I didn't knew it wasn't just soulful music & effortless            guitar            riffs but very well thought writing and has the deepest of emotions. Honestly I wouldn't tell you this            but            this week has been a ride and it's not really somehting that I want more of, it was uncertainity and            every            thing that happened could've been a whole different thing having it's own set of challenegs and            outcomes, it            was demanding to say the least.",
      "Okay I think, i have it figured out now. Imagine you (yes you!) are a pirate in a ocean full of            oppurtinites            (treasure), everyday as you wake up you have two choices either you search the ocean deeper at one            location            or you leave the place and search other places for newer treasures (yes just like you did in a.c. black            flag). Well that's exactly what I've been doing this whole time. I won't say that Reiforcement learning            has            changed my life, but maybe the Q-learning algorithms & Montecarlo simulations were not just something            meant            limited to AI, but in a broader way applicable to my current life. Daily I choose to stay at the same            spot,            don't get me wrong, I've travelled this year more than i've ever done in my life, yet. But fundamentally            I            tried to stick to a pattern that produced me some good results with my daily life. which was usually            working, and sometimes just overworking, which makes me feel productive and achieve in a shorter sense            of            time and when the next day strikes the counter just resets.",
      "Now what is wrong, if using this policy is giving me optimal results in my daily life, giving a purpose            to            my life, pays my bills, does all the good. well nothing actually, it is fair to be like this, it has            changed            my life more than anything else. Changed my work ethic and revamped my confidence. I've noticed this            recurring pattern, confidence -> better work & better work -> confidence and mastering this is the real            hot            deal. Honestly I'm pretty contentful of my current policy and just to put it out of my system, I'm            sticking            to this no matter what for a year atleast, I don't want to be a quick fuse. But the problem arises with            the            stumbling confidence when there's no external system what validates my progress. so that's something I'm            gonna work on, but for now I'm sticking to my roots. I wouldn't lie but still making changes scares me a            little of loosing what I've made and I know it's not completely true but it definetely isn't the most            easy            thing to give up on everything I've worked for and start again, I might not find a way back home again.",
      "I hope this doesn't becomes a message left in the bottle on a vast ocean of uncertainity and chaos, I            kiss            it goodluck and hope that it find it's way to the shore. If not I must forever be a pirate.",

      "It's been a month since I last wrote, but also It's been 6 months since I came out of my home to Jaipur,            to            work on something, there's always this saying that says that tells to \"work on yourself for 6 months and            your life will change.\" what do I say, ask me I just did that! First off all starting unrealistically is            pretty bad start to do, ask me, I did that! staying alone doesn't gives you failure, ask me, I had that!            also is this all bullshit? no it isn't, ask me I did that!",
      "Honestly it's a little tough for me to put everything into one blog entry and think it of as done, but            it's            my responsibility to write the truth, and here I am, writing my system logs again. I crashed before I            even            took off most of the times in my life but this time I took off, I took a great flight & I'm still in the            sky. Like a happy man I'll say everything worked out good, but as a person who's been through all of            this            making a sunshine world of your expectations isn't the best idea that works. \"I have a dream\" I've told            this            to my friends many times probably to some random strangers too.. but is it what I'm living, no, I'm not.            but            I'm working for it, alone. yes, honestly my dreams aren't that small that can be completed in a day or a            while. I've realised this over time however hard I push, I can't actually get what I dreamt of in months            or            days. it's going to take me years probably, at best. I don't wanna be disappointed for doing nothing            also            all those years, instead I've setup checkpoints in my life that tell me of how close I am, and this year            I've made some good leaps, the biggest of all possibly is knowing myself inside out, also working hard            is            one that came along the way. The Best thing to realise is things take time, being frustated about them            didn't work out for me the best was to work and enjoy the checkpoints as they arrive, I've been pretty            anxious about my progress from the start, I am still but the high of reaching that checkpoint is            unbeatable.            If going on a party gives you a high, this is mine, we are no different. Probably mine is a bit nerdy.",
      "Just so you know, I'll be checking off a lot of dreams from my boxes this year, a lot of em, I'm gonna            take            that flight I always wanted, go to that city I always wanted and maybe forget for a week that I was a            big            mess, Maybe forget all the music taste I've got and listen to Pitbull for a week, do nothing but dance            to            edm everynight.",
      "I started with having less self confidence, but I believed it'll eventually come along the way someday,            it            did. Unignorablly materalism helped in that, but not in all the evil ways that people made me think, but            rather in a comfortable, progressive way, also money isn't the evil, we humans are sometimes. Anyways            having            completed the 6 months defintely feels fucking great, it would've been better if I removed all the            external            despair before only, but life is always easier said than done            Also I made this channel, to push            updates about my blog.",

      "This post is inspired by Casey Neistat's video about hard things.",
      "Makes me wonder why I would do anything hard in life? Since I was a kid, going to school was hard, exams            were hard, dating was hard, going to college was hard, and working a full-time job was hard. For all I            know,            they all added great value to my life. But I wouldn't have opted for going to school as a child; I            wasn't            that smart, maybe. But as a grown-up, surprisingly for me, I opted for a lot of hard things this year; I            chose them now. Why? The question still remains, until life recently hit me with the answer. There are            rewards to most hard things in life. Working on myself made me more confident, built trust in myself,            and            changed my perception in a great way. And unlike childhood, where rewards were not that far to get and            were            pretty small, growing up, the rewards are far from reach, but they are really worth working for, and            there's            no better feeling than getting these rewards.",
      "Still, the question remains unanswered. Now I think it's how life has shaped itself. Getting that            short-term            reward of going to a party, spending all of my savings, and making my life crash to the ground            again—this is            thrilling to be real; I accept it. Working every day for hours, indulging in self-preservation, working            on            something great, building something exciting, making life beautiful in one more way is what I'm up to            these            days. Nobody really cares if you do either of these two things. I did both of them. Life is much harder            the            latter way—for weeks, months, years, nobody recognizes what I am doing; nobody cares enough. But one            day,            when walking into your room, you see yourself and realize how much you've changed. You realize doing            hard            things is what makes life beautiful. I realize creation is a hard thing, and this is what I'm up            to—creating            a better life for myself, being a better man. Even though I have days of uncertainty, there's always            something that tells me to keep going, to not stop, to walk it all.",
      "Hard things are what make life beautiful and meaningful. Even though I know I'm going to struggle a lot,            I            am not afraid of packing my rusty tools and showing up tomorrow again to work, lay concrete, build            steel.            Even if it means leaving my comfort, people, and my past behind, I am ready. All in all, I am learning            to            fly.",

      "Well a common observation that comes to my mind is that it's overfitted with a lots of data, don't get me            wrong but I see that my mind works optimally when I'm really in the moment working on a future goal            which is            not too distant/vague practical to be honest. even though ignoring it constantly the happiness I expect            from            life isn't possible through casual ways, which are easy to find, it's more of the longer time taking            Things that gives me off some sense of belonging and happiness.",
      "Another fact I can't ignore is how much important it has became for me to be self-reliant, it might be            the            buzzword these days everywhere, I mean living on            my parent's grace was only good till I was in school, now all the movie scenes makes sense to me where            the            rich kid leaves his wealthy parents and lives in a small apartment on his own, I mean it's not their            parents            fault but some time the aching heart is only self-repairable not everyone can do much about it rather            than            me, now I see why that rich kid wasn't stupid, even though I have never been rich to leave my ferrari            back            home.",

      "I've also noticed counting my repetetions during working sets, make them easier to achieve, kinda like a            mental strenght, it makes me understand how much this of verbal feedback is important for a workout, it            really kills my bad habit of forgetting counts during a workout, it's of great importance to maintain            workouts the way they are supposed to be rather than just lifting heavy weights mindlessly, it feels            more            like dance of mind and body, one falls down the other falls with it. Well, I've never been good at            either of            them,            yet.

I don't want to get lost now, I can't afford to, I will need a            guru            again in my life more than ever, more than I can explain by words. Someone to guide me through all this            pain and getting to knwo myself again, I know for sure I have to walk this path alone but not aimlessly.

      "Well the question that comes to my mind whenever I'm wake up is, \"what am I doing?\" Really yeah. even            though            I am the protagnoist of my own life I am rendered quizzical by this question. To tell you in brief what            I            actually do is, I wake up, I get ready, I sit at a desk for 10 Hours, I meet people, I do the things I            used            to like and then as soon the clock strikes 7 I come back to my homely abode. get some necessary            nutrition            and I sleep. Even though I'm made of flesh and blood this lifestyle makes me feel like a robot. I do            wonder            a lot while sitting at that desk though about life can be outside, about how exciting life really is            until            another notification brings some more work to be done. I feel crushed by this gravity of routine, which            is            obviously I can't be doing the same way.",
      "This might be another story of a guy who's comforted into life of routine, but is it what I want? is it            what            I worked hard for? There are a lot of movies about the guy who leaves his office and lives is his life            to            the fullest of their dreams. but how practical is that, the answer to which remains void. I am doing            some            changes to get out of this constant pull, I do take long walks to help myself get some extra of those            steps,            taking stairs once in a while. it does add up to a lot. Also I am thinking of joining the gym, I gotta            get            in some good shape before this year ends, can't be like this, no way at all. While it has been 6 months            since I started working on myself, and I'm moving fast I'll say, things have changed quickly. A lot is            there            to do, like I'm still stuck on getting the remote role thing, gym is to be started and many things I            want to            do.",
      "Obiously giving up on anything is not a option here in my life anymore, I do have to continue my journey            for            how hard it may seem, or how much pain it may bring, but I do have to continue for what life may bring            good            or bad, sweet or bitter, alive or dead cats. I mean it when I say this, I am serious about flipping the            switch, which is not easy thing to do for me, I completely understand the conseuquences of putting all            my            hopes in one basket and then failing, once and for all. I know acceptance is hard, it is painstakingly            difficult to            analyse myself in a tough situtation, but isn't this what am I supposed to do with my life, make sense            of            what I            have and move forward, but without acceptance I cannot move forward with my life, I can't make newer            plans            for Life,            as they say, to get somewhere, I have to get out of somewhere. Acceptance comes with the cost of having            to            curse your own decisions instead of blaming it on someone else, which makes this path difficult than            other.            Afterall they say all you need is some good speed to get away from this gravity and all my life I've            been            trying to            reach that speed, that Escape Velocity.",

      "the first challenge was a breeze, so I moved on to the next one, which was a more of OSINT, HUMANINT            focused, I picked up the contact from the dark web forum which was needed, the next step was to prompt            the            tele bot to get the right answer, I tried many prompts but couldn't get the answer from the bot, which            was a            end to my CTF experience, though I was one round away from getting selected I still found it            exhilrating, It            gave me that adrenaline keyboard kick I was long aching for, CTF was one of a time expierience. now I'll            be            really up for participating into more CTFs especially more advanced ones. I like the whole idea of            privilige            escalation. overall the fun of learning something and then putting it to use is the real thrill, such as            this            CTF, I am            more specific now I can            say, the priority of CTF rose above that of hackathons.",

      "Usually I just spend my sundays either at my flat doing nothing, oversleeping. But today thanks to a            great            recommendation from a friend, I joined a reading group here. I confimed the timings yesterday, I showed            up            early, I waited a while before everyone came in. When I met people today, it was beautiful :) I really            liked            how the community grows together rather than a hamster race in the world. I bought one of my favourite            authors, Yuval Noah Harari, it was like picking up my beyblade before going to arena, but it more of            became            a fine choice of my mind to dive into something deeper. I actually chose the book a night before to read            today, I even packed my bag so that I don't choose to skip it today.",

I met a lot of inspiring people, younger or older than me. I was feeling            great            at that moment, Then after the reading sessions was            over, I striked conversations with few strangers, I liked getting to know them, to learn about their            experience or most importantly to hear their stories. I met Karan, Isha and many others with whom I            instantly felt a connect            with, then everybody went together for a small brunch, we went to a local cafe nearby to have some fun            time            together getting to know more about each other. All in all, it was a great day, a day I'm down to having            again. The day went well, while returning I faced enomourous heat waves, I was nearly cooked by the warm            winds, anyways I managed to reach my flat again. Also at the time of writing this, I am also developing            the            website sideways, for now it looks fine on desktop but a little unusual on mobiles phone, where most of            my            readers are. I've also implied \"the less is more\" philosophy in my life, Usually I want to get            everything at            once, which is a casue of my anxiety or you can say deep rooted insecurity. I think there's only one            thing            needed at a time, not everything at once, By real example, I 't wouldn't need to be a high earning guy,            with            a            great physique today only. But what I can actually do is start working out today, go to gym consistenly,            also work on my job sideways to reach where I want, kinda breaking down my goal into actionable steps,            as            said, \"One step at a time, one punch at a time, One round at a time\"",

I also wanted to present it myself, but I thought of            something            better. I instructed the waiter to present it when we order something, and he did just that.

Also, it was a theoretical one, so we didn't reach any conclusion, but that was fine.            Sometimes            the experiment is enjoyable. We called it a day.

      "One particular first-time experience I had from the gym was the hardening of skin on my inner hand, and            the            older skin shedding off, due to lifting weights. Similar to a cobra, I also shed some skin at that time,            which            was a sign of change. Though I don't continue gym anymore, I do shed some skin every day, even            metaphorically.            I do feel the process of change through everyday things.",
      "I hate people who say, \"I don't know,\" simply ignoring the existence of something, fooling themselves.            I've            been misunderstood my whole life; even when I was good to people, it was seen as a weakness of mine.            What            can            I really expect from other people when my own girlfriend could never understand the person I am? For            her, I            might've been just another guy on the planet, no different from other people. It's the hurting that            follows            after every good moment. I am not the one to dwell in past and I will never do that, even through            hurting            I'll forget about this someday, but she won't. my life is more precious than that, even down or hurted I            still have to go through this pain, do a lot of things, get all those materialistic things in my life,            be            that fucking motherfucker who completes his dreams, she won't imagine in her wildest dreams. I can't            dwell            on anything, there's no remorse in my life for people who are gone, I have good people around me to take            care of, but do you? do you have someone who'll see you everyday for what you are, not for what you            look? I            am not surpised by the answer.",
      "I was ignorant too. I didn't consider power to be a big deal; I considered intelligence to be my daily            driver, which was obviously a bad choice for a geek. The feeling of people walking over you every day is            soul-crushing. It's not the intelligence that makes one happy; it's much deeper than that. Sadly, I            became a            person people could easily pick on. I choose not to be ignorant from now on. I've taken enough hits on            my            head            to understand this in my life. I choose not to be weak. I am a loner; I accept that. I don't really            understand            that there's a small line between dreaming and the other people I see completing them. A leap of faith            possibly is all it takes.",
      "I had my feelings crushed too, many times in fact. The time when my crush said no but tried to soften the            blow, I realized in fact the softening was never meant for me; it was their coping mechanism, their            mechanism            to feel good after doing something heinous. It really makes me think whenever I hear someone saying            sorry; I            know that it's not really for me; it's their feel-good verse. But the bottom line is, even having my            feelings            crushed, I always stayed at the bottom thinking there would be something good for me. In fact, I was            relying            on luck for a new life, for someone to do; in fact, it never works out this way. Dependence is cancer;            it            kills you from inside. This was the rock bottom of my life; I had nothing to fall back on really. All I            had            was some good friends and a family. I never had good confidence before; my mind is usually rewarded when            I            do            something meaningful, and for a long time in my life, I hadn't done something worthwhile, so naturally,            I            wasn't confident enough, heavily relying on other people for constant validation.",
      "For a long time, I never earned a hefty amount, always some small part-time jobs, so naturally I had to            rely            on my parents for support, for which they were kind enough. But again, I couldn't gain confidence from            that;            I            couldn't really enjoy spending that, other than fulfilling my basic needs. Now, when I am close to            earning            some myself, the first thing I would like to buy is some confidence. I want to walk into a room full of            people            as a man, not as a slouched rat.",

      "Woah, what a month this has been I'll try my personal best to encapsulate it. I still remember the first            day of            this month, when I took a break from the office to meet someone – it was kind of daring of me to do so I            had to            make some professional lie to make everyone believe it. It turned out to be a good memory of mine, I            enjoyed            that evening, eating the spaghetti I didn't like very much.",
      "All my life, I've been riding sinking boats, and I didn't want to ride any more. Even when things went            south, I            still wanted to keep up with it, trying to save something that wasn't going to stay despite my best            efforts. But            how would I know? I didn't even have the chance to give my best efforts. I don't know why, but nobody            really            wants to enjoy life for what it is, for what and how beautiful it can be. It makes sense when you            realize that            there exist ways to dilute your pain, to dilute your experience. However, the dilution of pain comes at            a bigger            cost of life, and in the end, it's a tradeoff.",
      "I also had to leave the sinking boats, as the wise ones say, you have to leave from somewhere to get            somewhere.            The phrase \"leaving isn't easy, so is moving on\" resonates with me. For some, it might be, but for me,            it is            painful. It leaves me with a migraine and chaos all together. I begin to love chaos in my life, or I can            say            that disorder is my order. My head felt like an exploding time bomb, ready to go off any second… but I            managed            through it. I managed through the pain, and in the end, it left me wanting to love myself, or support            myself in            the moments I never did. For all the stupid rules I set for myself, the lack of understanding about my            own self            is the thing that gets me into troubles and uninvited pain. I accept it I open my arms for all the pain            that            comes. I will go through it I'll rather be in pain than having my life fucked every day for some sad            reason.",

I didn't want the constant hurting to continue. I            refuse to be            someone else's second option for my life.",
      "If you didn't understand any of this, maybe you shouldn't try to. There's a lot more to my life than            this, than            any of this. After all this happened, I had an intense week of working on the prototype I've been            building. I            focused every second of my life on it, pulling late-nighters all weekend. I remember one fine evening of            constant hacking and programming I chugged three cups of dark coffee. I was like a workhorse, running            every            single brain cell to achieve the things at hand. I programmed the entire download page at night and also            the            entire backend for the prototype alone. I finally did it, thousands of compilation errors and issues            later. I            finally built something worth showing to people. I wasn't completely alone in all this my colleagues            helped me            through this process. And in doing so, I stayed in the present. I could feel every click of the mouse,            every            keystroke on the keyboard — nothing else in life, no pain, no regrets. It was a zen thing for me. That            was a            really memorable week for my life. I did all this with a ticking time bomb strapped to my head. I worked            past            deadlines, past regularity, and past comfort. I was in a continuum, unbothered and fast.",

      "I couldn't really say much, but the events of life become recurring sometimes, different roads, but same            crossroads. I had an office party, a celebration, which became a fun yet memorable experience of my            life. I've            been living in Jaipur for quite some time now. I've gone to Badi Chaupar thrice, and it holds a lot of            bittersweet memories for me. I haven't had time to visit other places much. Anyway, we planned for an            evening            above the ground, at Jaipur's famous fort, to really end the day with a royal touch. While my colleagues            were            busy taking pictures, I sat down quietly on a wall fence, tripping over city lights as they shone like            distant            stars in the twilight of the never-tiring city life. It was a moment of reflection for all the things            I've been            doing since I came here, and of how I haven't changed at all.",
      'I saw someone taking pictures of the city beside me. I saw her taking those shots, and I was in her way,            so I            gave her some space. Then I controlled myself, but I told her, "You can lower the exposure, the pictures            will be            even better." She said, I am also learning these days to click these shots", I did some tweaks on her            phone, and            she liked it. I couldn\'t resist myself, so I asked her to take pictures of herself. I clicked a few, and            she            liked them apparently. With just fine adjustments, those portraits looked beautiful. I couldn\'t believe            myself,            so I asked a little about her. She told me about the places she has been to and her experience of the            city.',
      'It was time to go, my colleagues ordered something, so I had to go. But before going, I mumbled that, "I            might            not like to have your contact, there\'s a beauty to missing someone." I asked her name before going. It            was            moments after going that I realized what I couldn\'t explain to her. I asked my colleague what to do now,            and she            told me to "run back". And yeah, that\'s what I did next, I ran back to the same place and said, "Hey,            Sandhya,            I\'ve figured out the equation of what I wanted to say. I told her about my bad experiences of meeting a            person            and having to stay in touch with messages back and forth, keeping the relation alive. There\'s a beauty            to            leaving things at open ends after all, we all want someone to miss. She really understood and said, "You            came            back now take some more pictures." I happily did.',
      "Then I had to leave I shook hands and left, and that was the evening I was yearning for a long time,            something            to make me feel alive and back human. I couldn't calculate if I am ever going to meet her I don't really            feel            sad. I feel some good in me and more contentment of what this day has been. Even if I don't get to meet            Sandhya            again, but one thing I know for sure how boring my life feels. I know contentment is found in the fort            on the            hill.

Solving            these won’t have much of an effect on how I perceive the personal hell of my life. Sometimes I have to            just move            on, keeping my head down. There’s no other path to redemption other than facing the pain I’ve been            through, not            just any pain, but the one that makes me feel alive, the one that gives my life meaning, the one that            lets me            sleep in silence, the one that I don’t regret having.",

This is the only true liberation. My decisions and choices are heavily            influenced by            the way I feel about myself.

      "Back during summer in my fifth or sixth grade year, I was hooked on playing games on my computer. One            thing I            noticed was that most games, like GTA and Total Overdose, they had this floppy disk hovering at certain            points,            indicating the save game location. This was where I could save all my hard-earned progress from            completing            missions. But wait.. why am I telling you this? Yesterday was one of those save game moments for me, and            the            location was Jaipur, Rajasthan. It started a few weeks ago with an online interview at a startup that            went well.            This week, I went there for an in-person interview, which was different because most of my previous            interviews,            except for the Air Force one, were conducted online. I was a little nervous about how it would turn out.",
      "The night before the interview, I couldn’t sleep much, not out of fear, but because my mind wouldn’t stop            even            though my body desperately wanted to rest. It kept running through different scenarios, most of them            untrue.            Short on sleep, I had to wake up early to catch the train. It was a pleasant ride with beautiful salt            fields,            especially the red ones. To keep my spirits high, I played some Coldplay music. After arriving, I took            the metro            and walked 4 km to the interview location. I was sweating profusely but I made it. I grabbed a random            book,            opened a page, and started reading until I was called in. The interview lasted about 45 minutes. I            remember            looking at the whiteboard and thought of using it, so I presented a system I had designed recently. I            know I            could have presented a better design if I had gotten better REM sleep. The interview shifted towards            philosophical questions, which provided me with a better platform to express myself and my thoughts. I            felt more            articulate. After the interview, I waited outside while reading a book about death that was on the            table. I dove            headfirst into some thoughts until I was called back into the room an hour later. They informed me that            I had            gotten the job! in an official way.",
      "I had to call Ritik and tell him the news. Then, I went to a local cafe and ordered some maggi to eat, as            I            hadn’t had much breakfast. I called Ritik, telling him every detail. Finally, I caught a breath. The            weather was            pleasant, overcast and cool or should I say it was “my kinda weather”. I sat there quietly for a while,            simply            feeling the cool breeze on my face, finally relaxing. I was happy. Next, I met Nandini as we had planned            after            the interview. I took the metro to meet her area and then spent hours talking, walking around the area,            visiting            parks and cafes, and finally going for some Udupi food & Filter coffee, I remember the bell they had put            up on            every table to call someone for the order or the bill it caught my attention and it was a polite way of            summoning someone for a work, I found it a great place to go around. then finally saying goodbye to her.            Now the            next thing was to come back home, I was slightly tired, but I didn’t want to stop exploring, so I            continued to            discover other areas before catching a late train. I waited for hours at the station, taking trips to            different            platforms, my legs aching from all the walking. Finally, I dozed off on the train.",

      "There are some things on my mind that I've been holding in these days, and I must write them now. Well,            firstly, I've slowed down in my search for good projects. Is it a lack of motivation? I don't know            clearly, but            possibly yes, or it might be due to a lack of positive responses that I think I should've gotten by now.            But            whatever it may be, I must keep going until I land something I want, which is to say, a good role in a            company I            want to work with.",
      "My cold emails these days are sparse in numbers, but I want to ramp them up again this time, rise like I            always            do, even better than last time. All these days and experiences have made me understand the importance of            getting            challenged in life. I would love to get my butt kicked by time, the sooner the better, before I stagnate            or end            up on the wrong path. At this point in my life, I don't want to get comfortable at home or at work. I            want to            come home every day eager to learn new things. I don't seek stability; I crave growth. All the quotes            I've heard            tell me it's uncomfortable, and I do want that in my life.",
      "I don't want to come home every day with nothing meaningful to do or succumb to the slow, tempting            comfort of a            bedroom. I want meaning in my life, and I'm going to strive for that for myself, not to fulfill someone            else's            dreams. Obviously, I'm not blinded by ambition to overlook the importance of the people in my life, nor            do I            want to give up the simplicity of life I have now. The idea of working on something at a desk for hours            seems            more satisfying than aimlessly sacrificing my sleep and well-being for others who don't truly value me.",

No beating around the bush, I like feeling exhausted, giving it my all every day. That makes me            feel            more alive, kind of weird, isn't it? I loved that feeling of watching montages from Rocky & Creed and            going for            the next round. Last time I made some mistakes working out, like not having enough energy or not eating            properly. I realize that no matter how many small mistakes I identify and fix in myself, there's always            room for            improvement. It's the will and the fire that truly take you far. Also, it feels like \"home is where I            am.\"            Wherever I go, I carry the good and the bittersweet experiences with me. Sometimes, contentment is all I            need,            and when I have it, my geographical location doesn't matter much to me.",

It took a 10-hour train journey to get there, and some            sleep cut            short. But it was worth it, as the morning began, I walked down the streets of New Delhi, carefully            looking for            my phone, as it has been seen people are fond of using other's phones more often there. I would've lost            my only            camera that day :)",

It got decided to go to a Select city which was in a close            vicinity            next. Forward to some time later I was standing in this crowd of thousands of people I never met, all            different            to me, all separated from me by huge gaps of culture and lifestyle. I saw people, different people. I            come from            a small, not-so-populous city of Jodhpur, also not as developed as metro cities in some ways, but what I            saw the            most was a cultural shift there. I shouldn't be going to describe the semantics here.",

I heard the world calling me, the life I always wanted, the work I always            wanted,            the happiness I always wanted, and yet I saw myself bound by the chains of luck, failure, and misery            which I            couldn't seem to break. After that moment, I felt a sudden relief through my body. That moment was a            realization. It was more than just a mere part of time; it came to me and I soaked it in myself.",
      'Then I continued seeing some other places visiting here and there and then finally taking a metro back to            the            station.

They spend a significant amount of time traveling in it only to realize that a good amount of time has            passed            by. "Thus life moves fast in a tube."',

      "I didn't take any rest, but I had to go to Pokhran the same day I returned from Delhi. Well, it was a            marriage            after all. Unlike the traditional city marriages, I found it actually intelligent who marry in smaller            cities/towns. It's a small and tightly knit bond what they have, not much of a show for people to watch            but            definitely worth going to. The main highlight which I enjoyed was the clear weather or I say            pollution-free            skies, that striked like a thunderbolt inside my mind to capture what? Stars. Yeah, I wouldn't lie, but            this was            one of the most beautiful night skies I've captured yet. It's just beautiful. I still couldn't believe            capturing            cosmic giants other than the stars and moon; this time I got to capture even Nebulas! It initially            skipped my            eyes too, until someone made me notice. I just couldn't take my eyes off the sight. Aaah, it's a great            feeling.            If you wanna see, make sure your brightness is higher and zoom in on the colorful pixels which you can            see. Here            are the shots. This was unreal.",

I learned SQL a few days earlier, but            it            didn't work out, as I hadn't covered the advanced sections, which were probably the important ones I            missed.

  //     "She pointed out that it would be difficult for us to be together and that there was no possibility of a            deeper            connection. I understood her perspective. Unlike other girls, she was always kind to me. I think She            knew I            wasn’t ready for a relationship, and that I had many things to figure out in my life. She was right, and            I            appreciated her honesty. She was becoming the girl of my morning dreams, someone I would be fortunate to            have in            my life.",
  //     "At some point, my feelings for her grew intense, and I found myself taking photos of coconut trees            whenever I            saw them. They reminded me of the coconut plantations in South India, where she was from. Anna seemed a            bit            concerned that my feelings were getting too strong, while I worried about whether I was causing her            discomfort.            We decided to stop talking for a while, but I couldn’t get her off my mind. I couldn’t find a            replacement for            her, as I did with other things in life. I had many friends to keep me company, but none were quite like            her. I            missed her sense of humor and our daily conversations, even though I had never seen her face. I still            have a few            photos of her that she shared with me, which was a small consolation.",
  //     "One day, I confided in a friend about my strong desire to see her face and hear her voice. She suggested            I            should just ask her, so I did. Unfortunately, she politely declined my request. In my free time, I would            search            the internet to learn more about her city, its culture, and the beaches, but it didn’t quell my longing            for her.            February 23 was a significant month in our story, and I knew I had to meet her somehow. I applied for            many            internships in her state that were similar and in line with my profile, for all the institutes I knew,            and one            morning while walking to the bus for my college, I checked my email and received an acceptance offer            from her            city. I was thrilled at the prospect of going there, but what happened next would alter the course of my            life.",
  //     "I asked about this situation with Anna and told her about my plans of her city and staying with her,            while I            promised her before that I’d meet her someday, in her city. I had other good internship offers, but I            chose her            city because I was getting impatient to meet her. After talking with her, though, I realized I might be            making a            mistake by sacrificing a good career opportunity. So, after some contemplation, I shifted my decision.            My new            destination became Trichy (Still close to her), a decision that turned out to be one of the best I had            made in            years. However, I was determined to meet her in her city at least once during my time there, and she            agreed to            meet me once, so it was a happy time for me. I was happy with travelling thousands of kilometers just to            see her            once for one evening. I actually wanted to suprise her by showing up at her college without informing            her, that            was the plan atleast, but I saw some flaws in this one as this would give her more shock than            excitement, so            this one got discarded.",
  //     "After spending a few days in Trichy, I decided to discuss the possibility of meeting Anna with her. I had            my            tickets ready and inquired if we could finally arrange a time for us to meet. However, due to personal            reasons,            she declined and suggested that I come after a festival. I agreed, remaining patient. But as my days in            Trichy            were drawing to a close and I asked once more, she refused to meet me, this time, for good. I vividly            recall            that morning, it left me feeling deeply disheartened. Internally, I felt fragemented. I took a day off            from work            and stayed in my room alone, avoiding the office that day. I was angry with myself. It built up in my            head.",
  //     "I couldn’t quite comprehend why she made that decision. I knew for sure she didn’t intend to hurt me, but            somehow, it had happened. This experience made me realize how intricate life can be and even her            smallest of            decisions profoundly impact my life.",
  //     "Overall, I believed it was over. We continued texting regularly for a few more days, but then in August,            I            informed her that I was going to deactivate my Instagram account. Subsequently, I chose to sever the            connection            between us, leaving our story incomplete. I began to doubt whether I could ever carve a place in her            heart, even            though I had hoped to do so. She had become a significant part of my dreams and letting go proved to be            a            challenging task. For months of her absence, it felt like a void feeling, something that’ll come when            you lose            someone close to you, There was no doubt she was close to my heart. I thought of sharing this feeling of            missing            Anna with my friends, but these constant thoughts of Anna would make them think that I’d gone insane, so            I kept            these to myself. Fast forward to today, this has become one of the events in my past life, something I            can never            respawn myself to relive again. If there’s any regret in me it’s getting more of that feeling of my            heart            pounding, that adrenaline racing in my veins, and that feeling of reaching an oasis in my mind after a            long            string of never-ending sunny days.",
  //     "After all this I tried being with other people for a while, but it never worked out, because of what, you            ask?            it was me probably, I couldn’t be that person I was with anna, never that same shubham again, that            feeling never            kicked back in my blood again, that feeling aah! just the memories of spending imagining about that            evening that            never happened, were more pleasent sometimes than being with another stranger (I understand it’s not            fair to            live this way). I stopped trying, to pretend someone I can be, I just didn’t try, left it completely.            while my            words might sound more poetic than practical. but lemme tell you I thought the same when I read            something like            this, being on the other side now, I feel it deeply, far beyond the small limits of practicality. While            I am            writing and recalling all this, many bitter-sweet feelings race through my mind, but there’s some future            to this            which I can’t predict now, but it is for time to tell. I owe anna this story, for all her kindness and            friendship that meant so much to me when I needed her the most, I cannot forget that. As I write this            she must            be 22, Though I remember her birthday this January, this whole aftermath just goes in my mind and I            couldn’t            wish her.            I am a changed man now, I don’t ever rest now, there’s no home for my thoughts and my body, I love this            this            life of a wanderer, without having a “point B” in my life, to sit at every bench in life I want and            start            walking again, with no desire to reach any end, just to see life as endlessly as I can, to never stop            for anyone            or anything that I don’t want. a ordinary life doesn’t intersts me anymore, after all this I fear of            being            ordinary in this world, I fear of falling for someone like anna and I don’t want to settle now, never.",
  //     "And that’s my story “A lost boy who loved a stranger more than ever, in doing so he found himself a new            feeling            he never knew he had”. Things get mixed up with time and you’ll probably hear other versions, “A mad boy            who            went way far away, then made a fool of himself”. But what you heard from me is the truth, I wouldn’t            tell you if            it wasn’t, would I?",

      "The thing about the moon and city lights is that they create a particularly large glare in my night shots            (a            good 1/3 portion of it). I am intrigued about how I can counter this phenomenon — there must be some            way, at            least that professionals use, and something specific for my use case. Well, all I can say for now is            that it            adds a good effect to this particular shot (apparently). You can see all of them here. I’ve tried            listening to            music while I click these photos at night, and it lifts up the complete experience of capturing stars at            night.            Oh and if you didn’t zoom in on the images i shared, you missed some important details, besides the            regularly            shining pole stars there are some dwarf ones you can only see when you zoom in on them.",
      "So, an interview is coming up again next week, this time for a data analytics role, and I am not nervous            about            it this time. I’ll prepare as a soldier, sneaky and sharp for all the traps coming my way. Now, from            today            onwards I’ll be preparing for the technical interview with a changed approach. Usually, I start from            scratch for            every problem or interview chance I have, but this time I’ll build on top of the things I already know.            One            thing I always missed is the question I am given at the end of the call to ask. But this time (I knew            it), and I            asked about the team in detail I’ll be working with and what we’ll be building eventually, this has            given me            some pointers for what to focus specifically and foremost to other things. So, got a headstart now. I            have            contributed to some open source projects before, but working on high-level markup or JS has never            interested me.            What I eventually want to do is contribute to operating systems like Ubuntu. I understand that it takes            experience to contribute to such low-level programs, but seeing my name in the contributors list of            open-source            operating systems such as Ubuntu or Kali is a dream of mine.",
      "One particular thought I have, which should not be led by open source — but it’s my blog, and I’ll do it            is            that I see pain and sadness as two different things now. Of course, they are two different words, but            somehow            their coexistence exists in our lives. Pain actually breeds solutions, I’d say. In my life, countering            it            requires doing something every time. Putting effort into something I love relieves my pain, and doing            that            sometimes requires a spark within. In short, pain is useful as it pushes me to do something I haven’t            done, to            push my boundaries, or to simply blow my thinking cap once again! I’ve had my fair share of pain in            different            forms, sometimes physical, sometimes inner. It’s not the best thing I’d want in my life; it hurts me,            causes            sleepless nights, takes away the comfort of those daily moments and things I enjoy. It breaks me, makes            me think            about life harder again, that it’s not over yet and I’m not done. I respect pain now for what it is and            for what            it pushes me to do. I am not at peace with pain, and I’ll never be it hurts me, and it makes me feel            alive            again, in the end, “pain has the right to be felt.”",

      "“chachu yeh dekho itne sare pakshi” (look at there are so many birds at once) he said, it reminded of how            simple happiness for him is, seeing so many birds freely flying at once, he danced in his own way. this            evening            while I was walking him to a local temple, as he’s used to going daily there. he told me that he has a            friend            who lives across the street and she changed school before studying in the same class with him, he seemed            a bit            down by this, though he doesn’t remember in his daily life it is still a memory of him, a profound one.            I am at            my mother’s home currently, it’s outside of the city far away from the thin air of light speed life.            he’s my            brother but still he says me “chachu” because I’m his only big brother and everyone else is a chachu, so            he’s            not bothered by saying me chachu. happiness for him isn’t a complex entity it’s just the things he            doesn’t            expects from anyone else, he seems to make some for himself. when I see him it reminds of how life            changes over            year, for once I was of his age, asking these questions, and how many years have passed by, I always            thought            that life is endless and my imaginations would always run wild without any bounds, but growing up has            instilled            this time factor into me, that constanly reminds of my mortal nature and the things i have been losing            since, i            have decided, not to let time take control over my life or letting things happen as they happen, I don’t            want to            be another person in this “one size fits all” and look at myself unmotivated and sad. I had a messed up            childhood, not particularly bad in any way, but I was a big mess in my past and there were only a few            balancing            points in my life which I don’t want to lose. even messed up I never gave up on anything and I continue            not to.",

I            wrote something, few days prior to today, I wrote a blog entry I had to delete, don’t know if someone            read that            but it was something I’ve been feeling from a while now, so I wrote to take it off my mind and it did            help a            little, I was angry about some events of the past and it took a toll on my mind, I don’t speak about            openly, but            hey this is my blog and I’m allowed to speak here, the thing is I find it hard to follow social            conventions, it            applies to a large range of them, starting from personal things, I didn’t struggle with this in my            chilhood as I            accepted everything with closed eyes, it’s not comforting to challenge everything you see, it makes you            seem            like a social outcast.",

      "I noticed one particular thing about me that I lack taking initiative in real life, sometimes it’s always            a            push or seeing someone do things makes me want to do them to, this is not a good thing I guess, let’s            say I want            to learn, “X” I usually do it only when I see someone learning “X”, and then as a part of the reaction I            have to            account for the lost time and the learning curve when I am learning. inshort, I need to build my own            roads now            before I see other walking on their own, Have you heard about building walls? not the actual physical            ones or            the firewalls, I’m talkin mental barriers, the things I build inside my head to protect myself or kinda            my rain            catcher, isn’t that cool? but doing so always makes me feel vulnerable or it points out i have some            gaping holes            in my mental system. that’s why It becomes hectic/painful to set boundaries is indeed a huge            improvement, not            only it allows me to better think of myslef but also it saves me from doing things i don’t want to, say            If I            never wanted to ask out a girl and I do it because I feel more good, that will always be bad decision            (everybody            knows that) that’s what I feel is a problem, the solution to that is simple for me, create boundaries            but expand            them constanly, and then I should carefully choose the next things i want to add to myself.",

      "What did your ideal future self look like? Mine was a cooler version of Shubham — yeah, sometimes all I            wanted            was to be a more “cooler” version of myself. Thankfully, I didn’t try smoking, but it was a significant            part of            what I thought a happier future me would be like. For me, being cool meant knowing everything happening            in the            world of the internet, computers, science, and sci-fi. It played a major role in how I spent my time in            school.            Although I was a mildly naughty kid, in contrary I was, a shy one too. I remember crying in my science            class            over a petty argument with my friend. I even told my teacher, but she didn’t do anything, and I could            hear my            echo of crying at that time. Well, if someone from school is reading this, you might remember me as that            quirky/anti-normal kid trying to do random weird stuff he saw on the internet. Although I wasn’t the            best in            studies, the conventional system of making notebooks and files seemed upsetting and boring to me. But I            liked            making PPTs because, for that, I was given some free money to go to the cybercafe and spend time on the            computer. I never really had access to the internet until the ninth class — it was mostly accessible            through            smartphones or using postpaid dongles for computers, of which I had neither. But when I got my first            computer at            about 12 years of age, it was initially about running different software, going to local stores for            installing            games/software on the system. I became fond of some first-person games like Vice City, Condition Zero,            Call of            Duty, Halo, PvZ, Need for Speed, etc. It didn’t had speakers so had to use the inbuilt less louder ones,            Then            slowly, I shifted to the building side of it, like removing the hard disk while the computer is on or            removing            the side of the CPU to see internals, disconnecting various ribbon cables, and trying to make some sense            out of            my work. Learning some tricks and tips that I thought were cool to learn and show other people, like            remembering            the different hex values of colors to point out people in class. It was all fun. As time passed, I            realized that            these little things that I love really very much were the things keeping me stable and happy, even            though I was            not a big shot in studies. I stayed happy, or as they say, “fulfilled.” My confidence was built on it; I            felt            more confident the more I knew stuff. It helped me keep my head high in school life, make friends, and            approach            other people. These little things that I did in the past had an everlasting effect on my mind, which is            how I            think every day. It is what I always wanted to become. While I looked for passion every day in life when            everyone told me to search for it, it was actually in my conversations (even the sad/dull ones), the            things I            talked about the most, the things that excited me the most, and I, being a fool, searched for it like it            was an            object.",

      "“It’s different.”, Just two days ago, on New Year’s Eve, I spontaneously reactivated my Instagram and            then            thought, “Why not clear my head now?” I went live and announced to everyone that I will be building            something            I’ve long desired to create. Not only that, but I cleared my mind of everything I held within it. I’m            uncertain            of the effect it will have, but it matters to me. It was a bold move for someone like me, who barely            tries to            keep up with trends and has never gone live before. I told everyone about what I’ll be doing, Most            people might            have expected a New Year’s Eve party or something which is quite unusual for a nerd like me, who rarely            changes            his hoodie (never did, just mentioning for context).",
      "I’m eager to create something — a super techy product that’s niche yet immensely useful to a select group            of            people. Over the next six months, this is my primary goal. I want to build something like a linchpin, an            indispensable creation or something like “tinyurl” which is a simple yet cool thing to build. I have            some            small-scale ideas. What can I say, I’ve spent quite a alone time now, far away from most of the thing I            used to            be surrounded with also, I’ve realized that the notion of a “BIG LIFE” is an even bigger lie. Let me            explain.            While it might appeal to some, it’s certainly not my cup of tea. I cherish the smaller moments that,            when            compiled, form the essence of life as we understand it. I’ve understood that most of the things that            appeal to            me, such as a top-notch internship or even traveling with companions, can’t resolve my life’s            complexities and            dilemmas. It simply can’t. What they can do, however, is alter my environment, maintain clarity in            thinking, or            give me time & space to care about myself. Instead of fixating on the flashy things that grab my            attention, I’ve            often diverted my focus there, believing that a superior internship could solve my life. Yet, the truth            remains            — the constant in both the “before” and “after” phases is me.",
      "While I live many lives at once, I seem to forget mine, bound by expectations, aspirations, and time.            well, I            don’t want to make Barnum statements, but I also don’t want to live others’ lives. Yes, I have been            doing so            until now, attempting to save relationships with holes that can’t be fixed today, dragging down with me            my time,            peace, and, importantly, my happiness.",

Quickly, I got on my computer and ran a check            for the            constellation names — indeed, there were more than one. This is what I found.. I am writing this blog            since a            prolonged time, I’ll try to stick to writing back again now besides all the rollercoaster ride of my            life..",

Are our bright moments the sole memories that define us? There was a time when I            feared            they might wield that power, but no more. This phase of seeking solace in solitude has become somewhat            addictive, a sanctuary from the pain. Yet, within this seclusion, I find comfort in the simple routines            of daily            life — pedaling to college, relishing breakfast at fixed hours.

The corridors of my college, once vibrant, now carry an            cold air            of desolation. Those familiar paths where friendships blossomed, where a mere nod brought smiles, now            lie empty            and dead. The classrooms, once the home to my imagination, now feel barren. a space where sharing            vulnerabilities became a rarity, the pain intensifying when unspoken. Thus, solitude seems the only path            to            avoid distributing this pain to others. Whenever I revisit these spaces, my thoughts implode themselves,            further            fracturing my already broken heart. making the winds even colder, a professor’s bad criticism, which I            ignored            initially, gradually seeped into my subconscious, irreversibly altering my perception. Though he made            attempts            at fixing later, though the damage had been done, irreparable in my troubled state.",

      "Am I diving into delusion? Not quite yet. I find myself ensnared within a timeline that was never            tailored for            me, or so I would assert. As a teenager, I may have appeared sloppy, not particularly active physically,            yet my            mind had already constructed an expansive world within — a world of perfection to me. Undoubtedly,            delving            deeper into technology was profoundly captivating, but there existed things beyond that. It was an            burning            sensation to converse with strangers traversing the streets, simply uncovering the narratives of others.            This            occupied a significant portion of my thoughts concerning my future, once I started living independently.            but            somehow due to some circumstances this interest of mine weathered away still somehow fossiled inside,            probably            because of how other people taught me to become a self-sustaining guy, which is indeed opposite of my            true            nature, which I got to realise real fast. also I’ve seen older people trying to find a meaning out of            life            (through pilgrimage etc.) I always wanted to make that effort early in my life while simultaneously            focusing on            my work, cause I didn’t wanted to get old and yet stand back at square one. In this restless life there            are only            limited balancing points in my life, some of which are the people close to me, this limited nature of            life, this            very situations I am in, makes me wonder more about the future, and is the cause of my sleepless nights.",

I sought to inhabit the infinitude available to me within this            ceaseless “life,” similar to an endless Pink Floyd riff.

      "“The convergence of two seemingly separate entities blending into a singular entity, yet they remain            seprated”            it is a curious aspect of my life. It’s similar to the interplay of yin and yang, where opposing forces            coexist            within a single existence. This duality, this paradox, passes through my experiences. Picture a coin            with two            distinct sides — yet it’s undeniably one coin. Similarly, in my life, there are contrasting elements            that run in            parallel. It’s the complexity of existence encapsulated within this paradox. At times, I’ve witnessed            the fusion            of both lightness and darkness, happiness and numbness existing simultaneously within me, a            contradictory yet            undeniable truth. I find myself alternating between being the composed, well-organized individual and            the            fragmented, vulnerable soul. Is this a trick of my fleeting memory or an inherent characteristic of life            that            I’ve sought since childhood? Nevertheless, I yearn for the simplicity reminiscent of those earlier days.            This            intricacy is reminiscent of my life’s “Perplexahedron,” a term inspired by the cubic planet concealing            the            fourth map of infinity.

What seems effortlessly simple for some becomes a bewildering array of combinations and colors for me.            In an            attempt to resolve this complexity, I associate outfits with my identity. For instance, I spent an            entire winter            exclusively wearing a black hoodie, even though I had other options. It became a symbol, linked to a            fictional            character, “Eliott” or Mr. Robot (A rogue hacker attempting to wash down the rich), representing a facet            of my            persona. I did good with it, even though I’m not a hacker myself, but I liked being called mr. robot,            reminds me            of Rami Malek, Next time I’ll pick something that reminds of Brian Cox :)",

In a millisecond, the            image of            pyramids and seashells wired in my brain pointed towards “Sunoh,” the album by Lucky Ali. It contained            all the            best songs that come to mind when you think of Lucky Ali. There it was — an old cassette covered in fine            dust            amidst a pile of other famous artists’ cassettes.",

So, I picked it up along with a bunch of other cassettes, cleaned them, and safely stored them            in a box.            Rediscovering this artistic gem brings great joy. However, it also prompts reflection on how a lifetime            of hard            work, passion, joy, and patience can go unnoticed by many. I realize it’s not mathematically possible            for            everyone in the world to know about every individual, especially as we move towards a multiplanetary            existence.",

Yet, poetry/art remains resilient, passed from generation to generation. I            believe that’s            what Lucky Ali did, that’s what artists do.

I really wondered about it, is there a quick            easy answer            to that? I was not patient enough to find these answers. But there lies something deeper than            finding those            answers, there’s this deep desire in me, to do something and dive in it headfirst, get so deep            inside that            even sunlight can’t be traced there.

I feel like I was driven by emotions at some point of time in my life, all my            decisions etc.            were somehow connected to what I felt and another time I took radical decisions, ignoring what my            heart            wanted, I’ll call them “just do it” days. I don’t like the extreme points very much in life, one            that feels my            complete life is a dream and another feels my complete life is incomplete code. To say, neither of            them are            enjoyable, the perfect fun lies in the secret mix of both these, it’s a sweet spot and I gotta find            it. Of all            the things I like in my life I enjoy brotherhood very much, I can say that clearly now (as I’ve            experienced            it) it’s the best environment I thrive in. To be surrounded by people of my age/interests, maybe            it’s a little            to ask but it’s a paradise for people like me to live in.",

      "Life’s taken an intriguing turn lately, heading towards an interesting path! Just a few days ago,            after several attempts, I finally cracked the code to install Kali myself. They say, “The quieter            you become, the more you’re able to hear,” and it’s fascinating — it carries that intriguing            spy-like vibe. It’s like having everything you need at your fingertips, a bit like wandering through            a vast candy store as a kid.",
      "With my reliable Wi-Fi down, I’ve resorted to immersing myself in downloaded content. “Permanent            Record” by my pal, Snowden — everyone knows him! Edward Snowden, the master hacker and the exile            king, needs no introduction. It promises to be an intriguing read, and I’m eager to delve into it            soon. Lately, I’ve found myself bombarded with Brian Cox’s videos, leading me into a philosophical            reflection: the choice between a finite, fragile life or an infinite, eternal universe. It’s            mind-boggling to think that we, essentially atoms formed in a giant death star, are the universe’s            way of understanding itself. When you ponder it, we’re practically the universe itself.",
      "Today, my buddy Trouser Pandi (Birayani Macha!) asked about my winter plans. Since hibernation wasn’t            an option, it got me contemplating. Here we are in another February of life, a bit wiser and less            stressed. This might resonate if you’ve known me from the start. Macha’s a cool and laid-back guy,            an introvert, which surprised me initially, but it’s true. He’s Sanjay from the 4th dungeon of my            hostel row in NIT — such a great guy!",

I absolutely love this song; it struck a chord in my heart instantly. I            definitely want to master it on the guitar. That classic country vibe Vincent always brings — I’m so            into that. I find myself dreaming of singing this song by a campfire on a dark night, under the            breathtaking stars, on some distant mountain. Ah, another dream discovered.",

      "Of the very few times I use my phone for writing this blog. This entry must be one of them. I can’t            pursue            music I guess for a some time now.. I can’t hear loud sounds and thuds they say. All these days when I            felt            bad about my health or just my bad feeling about the day. i thought I might be having a rough time            again.            This            continued for a long time. Waking up feeling tired again, just like I didn’t had slept, covered in            sweat. To            quote Bruce Springsteen, “At night, I wake up with the sheets soaking wet and a frieght train running            through            the middle of my head..” I’ve been told those might be some nightmares, but they were never really gone.            I            was            clueless and tired. Just last few days were about pain and rising again, I was having some severe pain            in my            head and I was getting tired really soon. so I decided to put a end to this thing, so I finally decided            to            consult a doctor for this, last evening I went. “I was having Migraine”, the doctor said, I didn’t            believe.            he            said it’s Triggered by sharp sounds, excess sunlight, family history. Sometime later it all started to            make            sense to me. I don’t know what should I infere from this, should I live my rest of life on painkillers,            it            does feel better without having those. This was very uncalled for at this time of my life. I wondered            that            why            does all the people who write diaries or blogs, die. Then I chuckled that the question was wrong ;)",

      "Ahh where do we start? 20 years back, perhaps.. it occurs to me that I never did think of future much in            college. It was living just one day at a time XD but now when I do, I feel good.. I believe I’ll be            fine. I            know I’ve got some struggles along the way but who doesn’t, and I ain’t going to leave them. now when I            do            care about myself It becomes easy to move on, easy to understand people, just to think about others or            getting            out of myself. If I see what I’ll do in some years, I think I’ll go somewhere I always wanted to go, the            places I dreamt of since 7th grade, maybe live a life I always wanted. I forget sometimes I’m just a            regular            boy, I have some little dreams too, I wanted to move to United Kingdom or london to be specific it was            my            dream since I was a kid, I like the city very much deeply engraved with the british architecture, the            big            ben,            the london eye, the thames everything exciting in one city alone! I wanted to work there on the things I            like            doing. maybe it is silly, but I still do. As I turn 20, I feel more closer to myself, to who I am. I am            glad            that I’ve got such great people around me. I’ll want to live with them more than ever. If a song could            express            what I feel it would be this. and someone will remember it more than ever. also I wanna continue “The            zero            days of life” to my 21st birthday too, maybe 22nd and so on it is kinda becoming my baby now.. also the            spotify number is at 1926 as of now.",

But one thing I can say for sure is that this            summer            wasn’t extraordinarily exciting, and I didn’t do anything monumental. However, it was undeniably the            best            summer I’ve had so far.

I get really            inspired from him and his life, he’s a legend and motivation for many people.",

My friends knew what I was            going            through during those days. Well, let’s leave the past behind. These days, I’m feeling really good, with            a            good            routine and lovely evenings. Maybe the essence of life is not to be weighed down. Perhaps we’re meant to            handle things lightly, to savor the small moments we often overlook, and to appreciate the goodness in            our            lives. Like having the opportunity to talk to a nice person or enjoying the lovely evenings that seem to            serenade you. That’s life — short and sweet.",

      "So, what’s up? Hit refresh and get going or stay in a sweet dream for a little moment. This weekend was            that            dream for me. It wasn’t instantaneous, actually. We had been longing to go there for quite some time,            and            Puducherry, or “Pondi” as we fondly called it, finally happened. Unfortunately, Ashwin wasn’t able to            join            us            on our biggest intern trip due to being caught up with work.",
      "So, Raunak Bhaiya, Abhijit, and I packed our bags and headed to the dream we had been dreaming of for two            weeks. Every day, we talked about the crazy things we’d do there, and it was quite an adventure! The            city            attracts you in every way, with its soothing weather and a vibe that makes your day perfect. The city,            once            occupied by the French, showcases its beauty in architecture and culture. The buildings are vibrant in            color            and an abstract art in their own way. My first encounter with Puducherry was before even entering it,            thanks            to one of my all-time favorite movies, “Life of Pi.” It’s a French craftsmanship, and Piscine Molitor            grew            up            there. His dad owned a zoo in Puducherry before they decided to move to Canada.",
      "The coastal city is a marvel of love and peace, be it the streets, the people, the food, or the            environment            —            everything. The whole day was a joyride, we hit the beach, and it turned out to be real fun, with            splashing            and riding the waves. After having fun, I had a very personal moment sitting on the shore, listening to            the            waves and watching the water move back and forth. In that moment, I decided not to settle for less in            life.            It            wasn’t arrogance but an inner call for me to listen to myself and appreciate the beauty it brought to my            life.            To bring peace and happiness from people, places, and winds. Also, just for a bit of fun, I decided to            bring            my girlfriend to Pondicherry before anywhere else. Yes, really. It’s a very personal place indeed, and            even            someone like me felt that. I don’t know what brought it to my life, but I take it seriously now. It’s            not so            much about the show or the photos; it’s about the energy of that place and the mutual happiness one can            feel.",
      "So, that was in the morning. In the evening, I got to hit the beach again and roamed the streets like a            tourist. A weird thought came to my mind — to make a video recording my thoughts — and I did just that.            After            finishing and taking a few photos of the sunset, I walked along the shoreline. I found a spot to sit,            with a            couple on one side and a man in his mid-20s on the other. I’m a bit of a wanderer, so it made sense for            me            to            sit there. I glanced at the person on the right, and he did the same. I thought of striking up a            conversation.",
      "A few moments later, he asked, “Where’re you from?” I replied, “Jodhpur, Rajasthan.” Then, we started            talking, and I got to know that he was a native of Puducherry. We talked a lot about the city, life, and            oceans in general. It became a personal conversation, and he shared his life and the colors of it, while            I            shared mine. I was very happy talking to him. After about 30 minutes, he said he had to leave. So, I            asked            his            name, and he replied, “Rohan.” Before leaving, I said, “We’ve never met before in life, but you feel            like a            big brother to me. I don’t have any.” Then I hugged him, and he left. Maybe this was somewhat what the            nature            of life aches for — freedom, happiness, warmth of a personal talk, and silence. It was a very            heartwarming            moment for me. Then I listened to the waves for some time while sitting on the shore, grabbed a coffee,            and            left for the city.",

      "“Life is full of stories” I think some people like me forgot the meaning of this sentence. In my            childhood I            liked reading comics at my parental house, that comics didn’t had any logical learning for me, but            looking            at            the photos, caricatures, goofy cartoons, just made my life fun. It was like diving into a fun river,            naked            or            playing into mud again. Well that was childhood, I wasn’t any social person, relations meant very            personal            to            me, like a thing only me and my mom would know. Yeah that’s something about my childhood I realise these            days,            as I see children smiling. So that was a emotional talk right? Naah, but a great news is I am starting            my            internship Tommorow, and it’s the time I dive into cybersecurity for sure, this time. Life’s changing            and            I’m            liking it, in a long time, I feel younger than ever before. I hope life regains the meaning it had some            years            back.",

      "“the real slim shady is here”, while scrolling reels found this theme song, “return of the tres” I knew            it            because of the game“total overdose”, it was the theme song of the game. I still remember every details            of            the            game, Ramiro Cruz is the man, all the missions, such as “The ambush”, “The father”, the rewind button            and            the            iconic train mission at last, one train, a dirt bike to chase and bullets flying all around.. gotta            rescue            your girl in the front of moving train headed towards broken bridge, iconic!!",

      "“daddy’s gonna buy you a mockingbird I’ma give you the world” writing this section listening to            mockingbird,            I haven’t been a fan of rap culture or hip hop either, but this one’s something, don’t know the beats            seem            to            sync your body functions, just move your head up and down, pretend like you’re a rapper too.. talking            about            music rock was my go to from the previous 3 years be it guns and roses, survivor, imagine dragons or            coldplay            or all the punk music. say anything but eminem’s a genius.. I thought once covering the room walls with            favourite rock album covers or movie covers, but the plan didn’t move further, I gotta have a color            printer            for that buddy! and that was foolish now I think.",
      "let’s talk about ion propulsion jetpacks for a moment, I know, I know it’s a lusty sci fi fantasy, but            who            charges for thinking or fondling the mind right.. but what’s this damn thing, if you’ve seen any of            marvel            or            black panther movie you know the spacecrafts don’t leave a flame when they fly, the reason they don’t            burn            anything for flight or don’t use any volatile fuel like hydrogen or ATF for that purpose, they used            charge            particles for that purpose, says ions.. well what’s wrong then, I wish there was nothing I can say, but            it’s            a            cruel world :P the problem being ions are not enough to generate such high amount of thrust to lift me            or            you            up. they say increase the voltage or propellent it’ll get you some more juice out the jetpack but it            still            ain’t that powerful to be a banger, try some new designs or use a hybrid (burn fuel and hearts at same            time            :P) but as a fan it still is far cry for now. it’s not that it’s a complete fantasy it’s already in use            for            spacecrafts. the jeptpack I flew in San Andreas (RIP ROCKETMAN) used fuel based jetpack instead of a ion            propulsion. check this banger to know more about ion thrust",

I’m two days from the practical and haven’t opened the            syllabus yet, I think all the fun can come crashing down if i don’t study now, gotta study bye..",
